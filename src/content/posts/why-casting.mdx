When we set out to build the future of autonomous AI organizations, we needed a name that captured the essence of what we're trying to achieve. After countless late-night discussions, we landed on **Casting** — a name that embodies three interconnected concepts that define our work.

## 1. Casting Metal: Forging Durable Structures

Just as metalworkers cast molten material into precise forms, we're shaping raw data and AI capabilities into robust organizational structures. This process requires:

- **High heat and pressure**: The intensity of working at the cutting edge of AI
- **Precise molds**: The careful design of data schemas and agent architectures
- **Patience for cooling**: Understanding that revolutionary systems take time to solidify

```typescript
// Like casting metal, we transform raw materials into structured forms
const organization = await cast({
  data: rawOrganizationalData,
  agents: intelligentSystems,
  temperature: "high", // We operate at high intensity
  mold: unifiedDataLayer
});
```

## 2. Casting Roles: Assigning the Right Agents

In theater and film, casting directors match actors to roles based on their unique capabilities. Similarly, we're building systems that can:

- Identify organizational needs in real-time
- Deploy specialized AI agents for specific tasks
- Orchestrate multiple agents working in harmony
- Adapt roles as the organization evolves

This isn't about replacing humans — it's about augmenting human capabilities with AI agents that can handle routine tasks, surface insights, and execute decisions at superhuman speed.

## 3. Casting Spells: Unlocking New Powers

There's something almost magical about watching an AI system understand context, make decisions, and take actions autonomously. We're not literally casting spells, but we are:

- Transforming static data into living knowledge
- Creating systems that seem to "understand" organizational intent
- Building capabilities that would have seemed impossible just years ago

## The Unified Vision

These three meanings converge into our core mission: **Building AI Leverage**.

We're taking the raw materials of organizational data (casting metal), assigning intelligent agents to act on that data (casting roles), and creating seemingly magical autonomous capabilities (casting spells).

## What This Means for You

If you're a student engineer excited about pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI, Casting represents an opportunity to work on genuinely transformative technology. We're not building another chatbot or automation tool — we're creating the foundational systems for how organizations will operate in the future.

The name "Casting" reminds us daily that we're not just writing code; we're forging the future of work itself.
